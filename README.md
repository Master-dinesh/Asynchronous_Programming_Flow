# 🚀 Asynchronous Programming Assignment

## 📚 Overview
Welcome to the **Asynchronous Programming Assignment**! This project is a demonstration of key asynchronous concepts in JavaScript. It includes examples of using **Callbacks**, **Promises**, and **Async/Await** to manage asynchronous operations efficiently. Built with pure JavaScript, this assignment showcases how to handle asynchronous behavior in real-world applications.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the demo web pages.
- **CSS**: For basic styling.
- **JavaScript**: For asynchronous logic implementation using callbacks, promises, and async/await.

## 📥 Getting Started
To run this assignment locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Master-dinesh/asynchronous-programming-assignment.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd asynchronous-programming-assignment
   ```

3. **Open `index.html` in your browser** or run the individual `.js` files for direct examples of async programming.

## ⚙️ How This Assignment Works
1. **Callbacks**: A classic example of how callbacks are used to handle asynchronous tasks.
2. **Promises**: Demonstrates the usage of promises to write cleaner, more manageable code for asynchronous processes.
3. **Async/Await**: Provides a modern approach to handle promises in a concise and readable manner.

Each section includes detailed examples showcasing how to avoid callback hell, manage multiple promises, and make asynchronous code easier to maintain.
